 /*3.17 (Game: scissor, rock, paper) Write a program that plays the popular scissor-rock
paper game. (A scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can 
wrap a rock.) The program randomly generates a number 0,1, or 2 representing 
scissor, rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0,1, or 
2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer wins, loses, 
or draws. Here are sample runs:
 scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): 1
 The computer is scissor. You are rock. You won 
scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): 2
 The computer is paper. You are paper too. It is a draw*/
